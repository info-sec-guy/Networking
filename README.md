## Anatomy of a Byte
- A single 1 or 0 is a bit `1` 
- Eight 1s or 0s are called a byte `01000001`
- Four bits is a nibble `0000`

| High bit  |   |   |   |   |   |   | Low bit  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 128  |  64 | 32  | 16  | 8  | 4  | 2  | 1  |


## Conversions 

Decimal Digits: `0-9`

Binary: `0-1`

Hex: `0-9` and `A-F`

## IP Calculator:
* [ipcalc](http://jodies.de/ipcalc) takes an IP address and netmask and calculates the resulting broadcast, network, Cisco wildcard mask, and host range.

## Common Network Hardware
Network Interface Card (NIC):
* Installed in each PC, server, and device
* Connects the computer to the network

Switch:
* Forwards traffic to destination hardware address
* Connects PCs, servers, and so on together

Router:
* Forwards traffic to its destination IP address
* Connects switches together
